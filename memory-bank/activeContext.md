## Current Focus

*   搭建项目初始
* [2025-07-03 17:14:41] - Created new SQL initialization script `doc/sql/ai_analysis_context_init.sql` based on the `ai_analysis_context.puml` domain model. The script defines tables for `payment_images`, `image_analysis_attempts`, and `user_confirmations`.
* [2025-07-03 17:27:52] - Wrote pseudocode for the core AI analysis workflow, covering image upload, analysis request, and result handling. Saved to `doc/technical/ai_analysis_pseudocode.md`.
* [2025-07-03 17:42:12] - Implemented the complete AI analysis feature within the `payment-tracker-analysis` module, following hexagonal architecture. This includes the domain layer, application service, and all necessary inbound/outbound adapters.
* [2025-07-04 10:29:46] - 在主应用程序类中添加了 `@ComponentScan`，以修复因跨模块组件扫描失败而导致的 `404` 错误。
* [2025-07-04 10:43:46] - 通过向主应用程序类添加 `@EntityScan`，解决了因跨模块实体扫描失败而导致的 `Not a managed type` 错误。
* [2025-07-04 10:54:18] - Fixed `IdentifierGenerationException` by adding `@Mapping(source = "id", target = "id")` to the `toEntity(PaymentImageAgg aggregate)` method in `AnalysisPersistenceMapper.java`, ensuring the entity ID is correctly mapped from the domain aggregate.
- **Timestamp:** 2025-07-05 13:32:02
- **Context:** Database initialization is in progress.
- **Details:** Executing `doc/sql/ai_analysis_context_init.sql` via a direct Docker command after the `roo` CLI tool was not found. Waiting for the Docker container to complete the execution.
- **Timestamp:** 2025-07-05 13:33:47
- **Context:** Observed multiple `crystaldba/postgres-mcp` containers running via `docker ps`.
- **Details:** This may indicate resource contention or previously hung processes. The initial `docker run` command for database initialization is still active. Continuing to monitor.
* [2025-07-06 12:21:41] - Designed and wrote pseudocode for integrating a real AI service (`qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct`) using LangChain4j. The pseudocode defines the necessary outbound port, adapter, and refactors the event listener to replace the simulation logic. Saved to `doc/technical/ai_analysis_real_service_pseudocode.md`.
* [2025-07-06 12:35:00] - Successfully integrated the real AI service (Alibaba Qwen) by implementing the outbound port (`AIAnalysisPort`) and adapter (`LangChain4jAIAnalysisAdapter`). Refactored `ImageAnalysisRequestListener` to replace the simulation logic with actual AI service calls via LangChain4j.
- [2025-07-06 12:43:40] Added comprehensive tests for the AI service integration.
  - `LangChain4jAIAnalysisAdapter` is now covered by unit tests, with its dependencies mocked. The adapter was refactored to allow dependency injection for better testability.
  - `ImageAnalysisRequestListener` is covered by integration tests, ensuring it correctly interacts with the `AIAnalysisPort` and handles both success and failure scenarios.
  - The domain model (`PaymentImageAgg`, `ImageAnalysisAttemptAgg`) was updated with `@SuperBuilder` to support easier test data creation.

### Security Review - AI Service Integration (2025-07-06)

**Status:** Completed & Mitigated

**Summary:**
A security review identified and fixed critical vulnerabilities related to hardcoded credentials in the `application.yml` file.

**Key Findings & Actions:**
- **Vulnerability:** Hardcoded Database password, Aliyun OSS keys, and an insecure fallback for the OpenAI API key.
- **Action:** All secrets were removed from the configuration file and replaced with placeholders to be loaded from environment variables (e.g., `${DB_PASSWORD}`).
- **Outcome:** The application's security posture has been significantly improved by decoupling secrets from the source code. The deployment process must now manage these environment variables securely.

### Documentation Update (2025-07-06)

**Status:** Completed

**Summary:**
The project's `README.md` has been completely overhauled to serve as a comprehensive and accurate entry point for developers.

**Key Changes:**
- **Content Overhaul:** The `README.md` now details the project's purpose, core features, and the full technical stack.
- **Configuration Guide:** A new, critical section on "Configuration and Execution" was added. It explicitly lists all required environment variables (`DB_PASSWORD`, `ALIYUN_OSS_ACCESS_KEY`, `ALIYUN_OSS_SECRET_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and provides clear instructions for setting them up, reinforcing the security best practice of not hardcoding secrets.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` have been updated to reflect the completion of this documentation task.
- **Deployment Status (2025-07-06)**: Containerization files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`) have been created and configured. The application is now ready for being built and run via Docker Compose. Next steps involve creating a `.env` file with actual secrets and running `docker-compose up`.
